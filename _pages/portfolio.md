## What sets the AMOC depth?
<img src="{{pdir}}/AMOC-Depth.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

Paleoclimate proxy data suggest that the AMOC was shallower at the Last Glacial Maximum than its preindustrial depth. Recent work has emphasized the Southern Ocean's role in setting the AMOC depth. We show that the dipyacnal processes, ignored in previous studies, could diminish the influece of Southern Ocean surface forcing on the AMOC depth. A new schematic based on surface buoyancy distributions in both the Southern Ocean and the North Atlantic is proposed.
