About me
------

I am currently a postdoc working with Prof. [Andrew Thompson](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/) at California Insitute of Technology. I got my PhD in 2019 from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where I was advised by Prof. [Ian Eisenman](http://eisenman.ucsd.edu/).

I am broadly interested in the dynamics of the climate system, with a focus on the large-scale ocean circulation and its interaction with the atmosphere and cryosphere. My research involves developing and using a variety of models that range from idealized conceptual models to fully coupled climate models. For more details, see my [research](https://stsun.github.io/portfolio/).

In August of 2022, I am going to join the Department of Earth, Ocean & Atmospheric Science at Florida State University as an Assistant Professor. If you are interested in ocean dynamics or climate dynamics and would like to work with me as a postdoc or graduate student, feel free to reach out to me by emails (shantong@caltech.edu).
