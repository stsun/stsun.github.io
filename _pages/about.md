About me
------

I have just defended my PhD in July, 2019. I thank my advisor, Prof. [Ian Eisenman](http://eisenman.ucsd.edu), for his continuous support during my PhD in Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 

Later this summer, I am moving to Caltech to work with Prof. [Andrew Thompson](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/) as a postdoc.

I am broadly interested in understanding the dynamics of the large-scale ocean circulation and its interaction with the atmosphere and cryosphere. In my PhD, I have been using a variety of models, ranging from idealized conceptual models to fully coupled climate models, to explore the physical constrains on the global ocean overturning circulation. For more details, see my [publications](https://stsun.github.io/publications/).
