About me
------

I am currently a postdoc at Caltech working with Prof. [Andrew Thompson](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/). I defended my PhD in July, 2019 at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where I was advised by Prof. [Ian Eisenman](http://eisenman.ucsd.edu/). 

I am broadly interested in understanding the large-scale ocean circulation and its interaction with the atmosphere and cryosphere. My research involves using a variety of models, ranging from idealized conceptual models to fully coupled climate models, to explore the physical constrains on the global ocean overturning circulation. For more details, see my [publications](https://stsun.github.io/publications/).
