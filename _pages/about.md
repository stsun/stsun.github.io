About me
------

I just defended my PhD at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego in July, 2019. Later this summer, I will move to Caltech and work as a postdoc. 

I am broadly interested in understanding the large-scale ocean circulation and its interaction with the atmosphere and cryosphere. In my PhD, I have been using a variety of models, ranging from idealized conceptual models to fully coupled climate models, to explore the physical constrains on the global ocean overturning circulation. For more details, see my [publications](https://stsun.github.io/publications/).
