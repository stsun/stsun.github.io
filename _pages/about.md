About me
------

I am an oceanographer at Laoshan Laboratory in Qingdao, China. Prior to taking this position, I spent three years as a postdoc at Caltech (2019-2022) and one year as an Assistant Professor at Florida State University (2022-2023). I got my PhD from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 2019. 

Trained as a physical oceanographer, I am broadly interested in the dynamics of the climate system, with a focus on the physical processes by which the ocean interacts with the atmosphere, cryosphere, and marine ecosystems. Specific topics of interest include large-scale ocean circulation, high-latitude ocean dynamics, climate change on decadal to millennial timescales, sea ice, and global carbon cycle. My research mainly involves developing and using a variety of models, ranging from idealized conceptual models to fully coupled climate models. If you are interested in ocean/climate dynamics and would like to work with me as a postdoc or graduate student, feel free to reach out to me by [emails](mailto:shantong@oceanrules.top).
