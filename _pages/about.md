About me
------

I am currently a postdoc working with Prof. [Andrew Thompson](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/) at California Insitute of Technology. I got my PhD in 2019 from Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where I was advised by Prof. [Ian Eisenman](http://eisenman.ucsd.edu/).

I am broadly interested in the dynamics of the climate system, with a focus on the physical processes by which the ocean interacts with the atmosphere, cryosphere, and marine ecosystems. Specific topics of interest include large-scale ocean circulation, high-latitude ocean dynamics, climate change on decadal to millennial timescales, sea ice changes, and global carbon cycle. The ultimate goal of my research is to have a fundamental understanding of the ocean's role in Earth's climate. My research involves developing and using a variety of models that range from idealized conceptual models to fully coupled climate models. I also try to involve observations in my research whenever possible. For more details, see my [research](https://stsun.github.io/portfolio/).

Later this summer (2022), I am going to join the [Department of Earth, Ocean & Atmospheric Science](https://www.eoas.fsu.edu/people/academic-faculty/) at Florida State University as an Assistant Professor. If you are interested in ocean/climate dynamics and would like to work with me as a postdoc or graduate student, feel free to reach out to me by [emails](mailto:shantong@caltech.edu).
