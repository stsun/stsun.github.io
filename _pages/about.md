About me
------
I am currently working with Prof. Ian Eisenman at Scripps Institution of Oceanography as a graduate student. I am broadly interested in understanding the dynamics of the large-scale ocean circulation and its interaction with atmosphere and cryosphere.

During my PhD, I have been using a hierarchy of models, ranging from idealized conceptual models to fully coupled general circulation models, to explore the physical constrains on global ocean overturning circulation.
