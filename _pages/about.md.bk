About me
------
I am currently working with Prof. [Ian Eisenman](http://eisenman.ucsd.edu) at Scripps Institution of Oceanography as a graduate student. I will start a postdoc later this year at Caltech with Prof. [Andrew Thompson](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/).

I am broadly interested in understanding the dynamics of the large-scale ocean circulation and its interaction with the atmosphere and cryosphere. During my PhD, I have been using a variety of models, ranging from idealized conceptual models to fully coupled climate models, to explore the physical constrains on the global ocean overturning circulation. For more details, see my [publications](https://stsun.github.io/publications/).
